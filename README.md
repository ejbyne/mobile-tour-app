###Brief

Our Cohort has been split into groups and each assigned a project of our
preference to complete and present on
Friday 30th January. Our team consists of: [Ed
Byne](https://github.com/ejbyne), [Ming Chan](https://github.com/ming-chan),
[Mishal Islam](https://github.com/mishal1) and [Nick
Dyer](https://github.com/nickbdyer). The team's brief is to "*build
a tour app for mobile.*"

Technologies are not specified within the brief - they must be decided upon by
the teams based on the merits of
each technology for the project. 

###Development Stages

---
     
####Version 0: Planning Stage

In our team's initial scrum, we discussed what would be the ultimate version of
our app, considering an MVP progression model, we determined what the *Car*
version would be. From there we began to discuss which features would make the
*Skateboard*, *Scooter* and *Bicycle* versions. We opted not to discuss what
would be part of the *Motorbike* at this stage, and decided to re-visit the
feature draw as and when we reach that section.
     
**Technology:** During our initial SCRUM a skateboard version of the
mobile app was brought together, one of the key decisions was that the
product would initial be a responsive webpage rather than a native app. In
discussing the technologies required for this, we did not immediately come
to a consensus. We therefore took the weekend to research the appropriate
technology. The immediate dilemma being, do we sacrifice easy testability
by using NODE.js over Sinatra/Rails. Or do we use this opportunity to
experiment with an increasingly popular framework in order to broaden our
knowledge and potentially also take advantage of a full Javascript Stack in
order to assist with consuming APIs.

Our second SCRUM produced a decision on the initial technologies we wanted
to use in order to bring together the Skateboard version of the app. The
features we discussed for the app were moulded into user stories. With all this
information together we created [Kanban
Cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) and published on
[Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1251864).
